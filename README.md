#title: SwiftHire: Accelerating Recruitment with NLP
Entity Recognition and Skills Matching
This project explores the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques, primarily
using spaCy, for the analysis of resumes to aid recruiters in efficiently processing a large volume
of job applications. The dataset comprises over 200 resumes sourced from livecareer.com,
categorized into diverse job roles such as HR, IT, teaching, and more. Additionally, a Jobzilla skill
dataset is utilized to enhance entity recognition within the resumes. Key steps involve data loading,
entity recognition, skills extraction, text cleaning, and visualization of job category distributions
and skill trends. Features such as custom entity recognition, resume analysis with match scores,
and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are implemented. The project
concludes with reflections on learnings and potential future enhancements, including the
integration of classification models and advanced visualization techniques. Overall, this project
offers valuable insights and tools for streamlining the recruitment process through automated
resume analysis.
